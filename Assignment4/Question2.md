2a)
the calling function passes the values to the function by writing these values
to the general purpose registers

b)
did not notice any extra code generated before the function with the multiple
list of arguments.

c)
the code that was generated inside the call function is "Push.W" which then 
we can observe later in the return of the function with "Pop.W". 

d)
for part C, i wrote another function to compare and contrast the additional
assembly code with what was generated to noticed the difference.
