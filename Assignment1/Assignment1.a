 I picked the Washing Machine for my embedded system analysis example.
 
Development challenges:

-Throuhgput: handles a certain of information based on washing machine settings that is preprogrammed by the manufacturer then selected by the user. Depending on how complex the machine could be, there can be a large amount of conditions the machine might be set to before running a load of laundry(hot or cold water, load size, special conditions, etc).

-Response: Fairly quick reactions based on if the machine encounters an error out of normal operations. This could be that the machine did a miscalculation of the laundry load so the machine might add on more time to the laundry cycle.

-Testability: I can see this being very cumbersome to test off the assembly and out in the field (customerâ€™s residents). I would imagine testing would be done on the internal embedded system electronics before final assembly.

-Debugability: There are no keyboard or screen for a tester to use on the washing machine for someone to debug the electronics.

-Reliability: should be designed for long term reliability which many consumers would assume so in purchasing a washing machine.

-Memory space: is going to be limited to specific functions pre-programmed based on the washing machines expected behaviors.

-Program Installation and upgrade: most likely a one time program installation and only essential updates needed after leaving the factory.

-Security: most likely none given that there is low to no interest for individuals to tamper with the embedded software nor this is not connected to a home network.

-Cost: most likely not a high priority for these washing machine embedded systems.
